    My current fave is you mix third cup olive oil, third cup, maple syrup, half cup brown sugar. If you can heat to melt brown sugar that makes it better distributed, but you can just mix them up and pour over 2-3 cups oats on a baking sheet and mix it all up and spread out on baking sheet.  Then you can also muffin in any kinds of nuts - walnuts, sunflower, pistachio, almonds (I chop up almonds), pumpkin seeds - one kind or any combination you like. You can also mix in coconut or sesame seeds - any or all.

    * mix in nuts, not muffin
  </li>
  <li>
    Then bake at 300 degrees for 35-40 minutes

    After you bake granola you can add any kind of dried fruit.

    you can use any kind of oil and different sweetener- brown sugar, honeyâ€¦.amount depending how sweet you like it.
